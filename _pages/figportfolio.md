## Portfolio of a selection of figures I've created over the years of my research projects

This figure shows the range of two types of tree species, Douglas-fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*) and True firs (*Abies* spp.) along with the geographic distribution of two subtypes of a virus that infect the Douglas-fir tussock moth (pie charts) across Western North America.
The *Abies* distribution is created by combining the distributions of all trees in the genus. 
The viral subtypes information is a combination of extensive field collections of virus collected caterpillars and historical data reported in the literature.
The pie charts are created by first spatially clustering locations across the distribution before calculating the proportion of insects that are infected by a specific type.
