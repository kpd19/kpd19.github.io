I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago in the Ecology and Evolution Department. I finished my PhD in August 2024, working with Greg Dwyer as my advisor. My research focused on studying how environmental variation impacts the Douglas fir tussock moth, which is an important forest insect pest in Western North America. They defoliate large swaths of forest in the western united states and understanding population dynamics is of management concern. My research uses a combination of geospatial analytics, compuational modeling, and data science to answer how forest composition, viruses that infect insects, and climate change interact to influence forest insect ecology.

I did my masters in Biology at Case Western Reserve University, studying the effects of El Nino and introduced disease on sea lions in Karen Abbotts Lab.
